NEW DELHI — The Congress party, which once ruled India for decades, is now struggling to rule its own Twitter account? 

In a spectacular display of **digital disarray**, the party's official social media team accidentally tweeted — then hastily deleted — praise for **Narendra Modi's semiconductor policy**, leaving followers confused and critics delighted.

The now-infamous tweet read: *"A visionary step that will position India as a global tech hub"* — perfectly mirroring the BJP's own messaging. It stayed live for **17 glorious minutes** before the panicked deletion.

## The Anatomy of an Embarrassment

The tweet was supposed to attack the government's **$10 billion semiconductor initiative**. Instead, it became Congress's latest **"self-goal"** in a long series of political misfires.

**Jairam Ramesh**, the party's communication chief, called it a "technical error." But insiders whisper about deeper chaos: **three different social media teams** operating without coordination, **conflicting messaging strategies** from Rahul Gandhi's office versus the official leadership, and what one staffer called **"approval paralysis."**

The irony? This comes just weeks after Congress launched its much-hyped **"Digital Bharat, Democratic Bharat"** campaign promising tech-savvy governance.

## Who's Running This Show?

The digital department reports to **Rohan Gupta** (head of social media), who reports to **Jairam Ramesh** (communications chief), who reportedly checks with **K C Venugopal** (organization general secretary), who likely consults... well, you get the picture.

Meanwhile, **Rahul Gandhi's "Bharat Jodo Yatra"** team operates its own parallel digital universe, often posting content that contradicts the main party line.

As one former digital team member told us: *"There are more layers than a wedding cake, and everyone's afraid of the cherry on top."*

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about one deleted tweet. It's about a party that:

- **Spent ₹50 crore on "digital transformation"** but can't manage basic social media
- **Hired fancy consultants from Harvard** while their ground workers lack smartphones
- **Promotes "young leadership"** but maintains rigid hierarchical controls
- **Criticizes Modi's tech policies** while accidentally praising them

The BJP's IT cell, led by **Amit Malviya**, didn't miss the opportunity. Within minutes, they'd created memes showing Congress leaders as confused emojis with the caption: *"Even their fingers support Modiji!"*

## Historical Context

This is the same party that:
- **Resisted computerization** in the 1990s
- **Mocked digital India** as "chaiwala fantasy"
- **Fought Aadhaar tooth and nail** while now demanding direct benefit transfers
- **Complains about EVM hacking** while struggling with basic Twitter management

As one political analyst noted: *"They want to fight 21st-century battles with 20th-century weapons and 19th-century strategies."*

## What Next?

Congress promises a "thorough review" of its digital operations. Translation: expect more committees, more consultants, and probably another accidental pro-Modi tweet.

Meanwhile, the BJP's **digital war room** continues its 24/7 operations, outspending Congress **10:1** on social media ads and reaching **50 times more users** daily.

## The Bias Takeaway

A political party that can't manage its Twitter account probably can't manage a country.

As a former Congress minister famously said (off record, of course):
> "We have too many captains, no sailors, and the ship is busy sending mixed signals."


The deleted tweet may be gone from the platform, but it's permanently etched in India's political memory — another reminder that in the digital age, competence can't be faked.
